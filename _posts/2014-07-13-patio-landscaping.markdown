description: This patio was commissioned to add the finishing touches to a new-build holiday cottage. We leveled uneven ground, supplied hardcore, built footings and walls for the raised central planter, and laid the stones. A range of slabs in different sizes and colours used to give a more rustic country look, with a beautiful curved stone wall built around the outside. Our customer was delighted with the end result, and the garden is now thriving!
